With Posture, you will be capable of saving multiple positions of unlimited objects! data can be stored in two ways, global and local (parent-related) or even both of them at the same time, therefore it is capable of storing character figures and different decoration of elements as well. Furthermore, few other pieces of information will be stored from selected objects, like WireColor, Parent, Children list, Name.

with Posture, you will be able to recreate empty nodes, which were deleted. They will be recreated with the same name, color, and hierarchical connection.

#   Attention:
 
       1. If you are working on a rig, save controllers and helpers transform instead of rig structure.
       2. If you are saving Local (parent-related) transforms, your objects should have a parent.
       3. When you want to create a global transform, it saved absolute transform from the origin.
